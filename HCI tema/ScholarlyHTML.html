      <section id="Application Architecture">

        <h2>3. Application Architecture</h2>

        <section id="Login/Signup Page">
          <h3>3.1 Log In / Sign Up Page</h3>
          <img src="LogInSignUpPage.png" alt="LogSign">
          <p>
            The first page that opens up when an user acceses the site is the "Log In/Sign Up"
            page where they will be asked to either log into an existing account using a username
            and the respective password or create a new account using the former mentioned attributes
            and an email.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="Editor/Compiler Page">
          <h3>3.2 Editor/Compiler Page</h3>
          <img src="EditorPage.png" alt="Editor">
          <p>
            After the user is logged in, the next page that opens up is the editor/compiler one.
            If the user has just created a new account then the editor side of the page will
            display a blank file. If the user has previously worked on something then that file
            will be on display.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here the user can run and compile a file they choose and get the results on the "OUTPUT"
            side of the page (like in the example presented in the picture). They do this by clicking the
            button on the left side. Here they can also check the official documentation for Dafny (the
            button on the right side).
          </p>
          <p>
            After they are done with working on their program or want to save their work there is a
            dropdown button on the header named "File" which has the options to save their work on
            their account, on their personal computer, to delete the current file
            and also to load another file from their computer onto the website editor. 
            This can also be done with the "+" button next to the files opened in the editor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another thing a user can do is check the examples provided by the website by clicking
            the dropdown button named "Examples" that is next to the "File" one
            and further develop them.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="My files Page">
          <h3>3.1 My files Page</h3>
          <img src="MyFilesPage.png" alt="Myfiles">
          <p>
            From the editor page the user can click on their username at the top right side of
            the page. The next page that opens will be the My files page where they can see
            all the files they've saved. Here they can open one in the editor, create a new one
            or load a file from their computer similar to the dropdown "File" from the editor page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here they could also choose to go to their settings or log out.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="Settings Page">
          <h3>3.1 Settings Page</h3>
          <img src="SettingsPage.png" alt="Settings">
          <p>
            Coming from the files page, here the user can change anything about their profile: profile
            picture, username, email and password.
          </p>
          <p>
            Again they could also choose to go to their files page or log out.
          </p>

        <h2>3. Concepts</h2>

        <section id="Design patterns">
          <h3>3.1 Design Patterns</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Syntax Highlighting - In the editor page, writing code with little to no syntax highlighting is really
              difficult and after some time it could cause eyestrain
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Line Numbering - In the editor page the code lines are numbered making searching for
              errors and bugs easier
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Navigation - In the files page the user can search for a file using the
              search bar
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Keyboard Shortcuts - At the top of the "Run" button the shortcut for the same function
              is written because the website contains repetitive tasks that involves switching
              modes from keyboard to mouse (writing code to running it)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Autosaving - At the top of the files header there is specified that the files are
              autosaved every 30 seconds and that helps the user focus on producing great
              content without worrying about whether their data is safe and saved
            </li>
          </ul>



        </section>
        <section id="QOC">

          <h2>4. Questions, Options, Criteria</h2>

          <h3>4.1 Q: What happens if the website is used from a mobile?</h3>

          <p> Because on the larger screens in the main page the editor part and the output/terminal
            part are side by side on a smaller screen they will be stacked upon one another.
          </p>

          <h3>4.2 Q: What if the user has too many files saved on his account and can't find one?</h3>

          <p>
            The search bar was created for this and also in the example picture it is visible that
            in the rectangle associated with file_1 you can see a portion of the code saved in that
            same file. That is because the user may remember what the file contained just from the
            snapshot of the code.
          </p>


          <h3>4.3 Q: What if the user can't see the code they are writing clearly?</h3>

          <p>
            For this potential issue the editor uses syntax highlighting and also line numbering.
            Besides, they may also zoom in on the code using zoom in and zoom out icons on the right
            side of the editor.
          </p>
